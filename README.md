# Onyx
A 1.19.2 Crystal PVP ghost client

# now released to the public...
I've decided to release the code, as the project is old, and the people involved left the project a long time ago. Have fun skidders, ig?

The codebase is aids, due to the base we used. I wasn't ever actively involved in the developement, and we considered rewriting the client, but it died before anything happened.
